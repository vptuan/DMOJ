CCC '11 S1 - English or French?

Canadian Computing Competition: 2011 Stage 1, Senior #1
You would like to do some experiments in natural language processing. Natural language processing (NLP) involves using machines to recognize human languages.

Your first idea is to write a program that can distinguish English text from French text.

After some analysis, you have concluded that a very reasonable way of distinguishing these two languages is to compare the occurrences of the letters t and T to the occurrences of the letters s and S. Specifically:

if the given text has more t and T characters than s and S characters, we will say that it is (probably) English text;
if the given text has more s and S characters than t and T characters, we will say that it is (probably) French text;
if the number of t and T characters is the same as the number of s and S characters, we will say that it is (probably) French text.

N = int(input())
count_t = 0
count_s = 0

for i in range(N):
    line = input()
    count_s += line.count('s')
    count_s += line.count('S')
    count_t += line.count('t')
    count_t += line.count('T')
    
if (count_s>= count_t):
    print("French")
else:
    print("English")
